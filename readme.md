ASFLIP Demo
================
![Screenshot](http://yunfei.work/asflip/figs/example.png)
This is a Python implementation of the ASFLIP advection method (http://yunfei.work/asflip/). We would like to hear from you if you appreciate this work.

Dependencies
--------------------
This demo depends on [Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi). You may follow its [documentation](https://docs.taichi.graphics/) for installation, or simply type `pip install taichi` under a Python 3 environment.

Run the Demo
--------------------
To run the demo, simply type `python pyasflip.py` under a Python 3 environment with Taichi installed.

Press R to reset; `Space` to pause/start the simulation; `Left`/`Right` to switch between advection schemes.
